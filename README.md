# IoT Spatial Data Visualization & Analysis

This project is a visualization tool for location based IoT data transmissions. The intended use of this program is for the analysis of fleet vehicle movement. 

Latitude and longitude transmissions are enginerred to create custom heatmaps and an accurate temporal analysis of the IoT enabled objects. 

# About the Project

* Notable Features
* .xlsx data files are processed in a multithreaded map reduce pattern for quick processing
* Folium heatmaps with custom pop up tooltips
* Aggregate temporal analysis for each IOT object 
* Kernel Density Estimate plots of IOT object activity
